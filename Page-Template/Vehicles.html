    <h2> Whole Life Insurance</h2>
         <p> <li> Whole life insurance covers for an individual’s 
         lifetime and offers cash accumulation, such as funds for
         retirement or education. This insurance plan has higher returns
         than a Municipal Bond portfolio. A municipal bond portfolio is 
         where an investor purchases a municipal bond, which is loaning
         money in exchange for interest payments.</li>

    <h2> Term Insurance</h2>
    <p> <li> Term insurance provides coverage for a certain period of time 
        at a low-cost. The insurance protects against financial hardships that may 
        occur after the death of an individual, which can be beneficial when you’re 
        trying to pay off a debt or doing business deals. </li></p>

    <h2>Investments: Equities, Bonds, Real Assets </h2>
        <p> <li> Equities are the shares that you purchase from a company. A bond is
                 a loan issued by the government where you can get interest payments 
                 in return. Real assets are physical assets, such as real estate.</li></p>
                 
    <h2> Life Insurance</h2>
    <p><li> Term life insurance provides financial protection for a fixed amount of years
         if an unfortunate event occurs. The financial protection helps your entire family
          with their savings and expenses. Term insurance is also affordable and flexible
        since an individual can adjust their coverage for benefits. </li></p>
