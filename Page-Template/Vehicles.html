        <h2> Whole Life Insurance</h2>
        <p>
            Whole life insurance covers for an individual’s lifetime and offers cash accumulation, such as funds for retirement or education. This insurance plan has higher returns than a Municipal Bond portfolio.
             A municipal bond portfolio is where an investor purchases a municipal bond, which is loaning money in exchange for interest payments.
