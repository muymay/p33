    <h2> Whole Life Insurance</h2> <br>
         <p> <ul> As noted by, Exectuive Planning.Inc</ul>
       <i> “Whole Life is a form of life insurance that 
            offers protection and cash accumulation. Executive
             Planning recommends this type of policy to an individual 
             who is looking to accumulate funds for either retirement, 
             education funding, or to supplement their income in the future. 
             It is often used to replace a Municipal Bond portfolio. Returns on 
             a Whole Life policy are usually higher than a Municipal Bond and lower 
             than long-term corporate bonds. Whole Life insurance makes a lot of sense 
             in the right situation.” (Executive Planning.Inc)</i> 
             <br><br>
        In Summary, Whole life insurance covers for an individual’s 
         lifetime and offers cash accumulation, such as funds for
         retirement or education. This insurance plan has higher returns
         than a Municipal Bond portfolio. A municipal bond portfolio is 
         where an investor purchases a municipal bond, which is loaning
         money in exchange for interest payments.

    <h2> Term Insurance</h2> <br>
    <p> <ul>As noted by, Exectuive Planning.Inc</ul> 
        <i> “Term insurance can provide low-cost coverage for a specific period of time 
            (the “term”) –most likely during an individual’s peak earning years when death
             can cause the greatest financial hardship. A term is also a good option for 
             covering needs that aren’t permanent. For instance, you may decide that you only
              need coverage until your children graduate college or a particular debt is paid off, 
              such as a mortgage, or business responsibility is fulfilled. Generally, the most 
              affordable type of life insurance when initially purchased, term insurance generally
               pays a benefit only if you die during the select period of coverage.” 
               (Executive Planning.Inc) </i>
               <br> <br>
                In Summary, Term insurance provides coverage for a certain period of time 
                 at a low-cost. The insurance protects against financial hardships that may 
                occur after the death of an individual, which can be beneficial when you’re 
                trying to pay off a debt or doing business deals.

    <h2>Investments: Equities, Bonds, Real Assets </h2> <br>
        <p> <ul> As noted by, U.S Bank</ul>
            <i> “Our equities research retains a home bias in favor of U.S. equities. We believe higher 
                accounting standards, shareholder friendliness, corporate governance, and rule-of-law generally 
                favor domestic companies over international firms. Many U.S. companies are multi-national in nature, which 
                means investments in domestic firms still provide access to overseas markets.
                    <br><br>
                We conduct our research on fixed income – or bonds – for providing current income, 
                diversification against the risk of equities and other types of assets, and protection against 
                deflation. In non-taxable accounts (such as IRAs), we believe in owning traditional domestic government 
                and agency bonds. For both taxable and non-taxable accounts, we also believe in exposure to 
                high-yield bonds which create an opportunity for higher levels of income and returns than traditional 
                bonds typically do.
                    <br><br>
                We take the real asset, or nonfinancial, category into account to insulate investors from 
                inflationary risks. Although inflation has generally not been a concern in recent times,
                 it can emerge quickly and have adverse portfolio effects. Inflation-protecting sectors 
                 include real estate, various subsectors of the equity market including energy and energy 
                 logistics companies, infrastructure, metals, farmland, timber and other portfolio instruments 
                 designed to counteract inflation’s corrosive effects.” (U.S. Bank) </i> 
                     <br> <br> 
                In Summary,Equities are the shares that you purchase from a company. A bond is
                 a loan issued by the government where you can get interest payments 
                 in return. Real assets are physical assets, such as real estate.
