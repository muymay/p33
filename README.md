# Description
Financial literacy is a really broad term, but can generally be understood as an individual’s ability to not just comprehend information as it
relates to personal finances but to also make decisions and act in a way that promotes personal financial wellbeing.
The areas that one can become financially competent are many and include (but are not limited to):
Budgeting and saving
Understanding and strategically using debt like credit cards, loans
Investing for retirement
Notably, each area of competency can really be mapped to a facet of financial wellness. For example - budgeting and saving enables
shorter term financial security and being able to weather emergencies while being savvy about investing enables ownership and long
term generation / preservation of wealth.
Again, the overarching theme here is that becoming financially literate is very much a pre-requisite for achieving overall financial
wellness.
In spite of the importance of being financially literate, studies show that there exist disparities in financial literacy rates across not just
racial and ethnic groups but age and gender groups as well. There are many factors at play, including the fact that personal finance is
oftentimes not explicitly taught as part of a school’s curriculum.
As aspiring engineers and technologists, how can you use technology to effect positive change and narrow the financial literacy gap?
Can your team identify one specific problem area and propose + build a solution to address it?

# Additional guidance
- While the problem statement is intentionally ambiguous to offer teams flexibility and creative freedom in responding, the expectation is
for teams to research and identify a specific problem they want to tackle and then to deliver an associated solution. In terms of scope - it
is NOT necessarily to ask teams broadly solve the wider problem of the financial literacy gap all at once.
- Some sample domains teams can hone in on (coincidentally these at there main pillars of M1’s product!):
Investing
Spending and saving
Lending and the value of debt
- Sample problem areas teams can focus on:
Awareness
Education
Enablement
- Sample deliverables:
Lots of fun + useful visualization projects
Demonstrate the power of compound interest
Demonstrate the value of diversification in investing
Scenario simulations - Dollar cost averaging vs timing the market
Retirement planning tools
Personal budgeting + analytics tools

# Learning Goals
Exposure to the domain of personal finance - in a very meta way, we hope to narrow the financial literacy gap just through participation
in this project
Exposure to a product mindset and first principles thinking - emphasis on the problem we’re trying to solve rather than fixate on
solutions, which can and will change overtime. The aim is to help guide teams through the type of ambiguity that companies and project
teams oftentimes face for real in the professional world.
Exposure to process / tooling - dependent on specific proposed solution
